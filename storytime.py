There once was a cat named Hamilton who lived with a family of sheep.
No one really remembers how Hamilton came to live with the sheep.
One day the sheep woke up to meowing and saw a cat on the edge of the field.
"Greetings!" said the cat.
"I am Hamilton."
The sheep were quite content with having another addition to the group.

The sheep introduced Hamilton to its flock. The sheep said, "Meet my flock!"
"Hello, flock" said Hamilton.
Hamilton began to live and learn with the sheep.
The cat spent the first day eating grass. The sheep introduced Hamilton to their favorite patch of land.
Hamilton was not accustomed to eating grass.
The sheep baa-d in good humor at his plight.
