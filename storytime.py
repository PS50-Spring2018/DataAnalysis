There once was a cat named Hamilton who lived with a family of sheep.
No one really remembers how Hamilton came to live with the sheep.
One day the sheep woke up to meowing and saw a cat on the edge of the field.
"Greetings!" said the cat.
"I am Hamilton."
The sheep were quite content with having another addition to the group.

The sheep introduced Hamilton to its flock. The sheep said, "Meet my flock!"
"Hello, flock" said Hamilton.

The sheep and Hamilton spent that day mostly sleeping, drinking water from the pond, and singing songs.
Although it was a lazy day, Hamilton felt pretty hungry.
He noticed some of the sheep were chewing on the grass, so he knelt down and took a big bite.

Unfortunately for Hamilton, the grass that he had been chewing on was pesticide-ridden. He immediately began convulsing.

The sheep baa-d in good humor at his plight.




At the sight of poor hamilton's convulsing the sheep immediately began laughing. They had a deep distrust of all cats, and were happy that the feline was in pain!

"Hurrah" shouted Timmy, the leader of the sheep. "Down with cats!" responded the flock in unison

Hamilton spat out the grass, chuckled, walked over to the pond, and jumped in.
Hamilton, with a huge paw swipe, skewered a fish out of the water.
He lept out of the water, fish in hand, and happily munched away.

But alas, out of the water followed a hungry snapping turtle. He had once tasted a cat, and had become forever addited by its sweet, succulent taste.
