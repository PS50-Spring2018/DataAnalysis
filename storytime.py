'''
There once was a cat named Hamilton who lived with a family of sheep.
No one really remembers how Hamilton came to live with the sheep.
One day the sheep woke up to meowing and saw a cat on the edge of the field.
"Greetings!" said the cat.
"I am Hamilton."
The sheep were quite content with having another addition to the group.
